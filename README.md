# MMTrade Software - Lot Calculation Algorithm

## Description
This code represents the lot calculation algorithm of the MMTrade Software developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. The MMTrade Software is designed to assist traders in calculating the appropriate lot size for their trades based on the specified stop loss value and risk percentage. Additionally, the code includes functions for setting limit order price level, implementing key '2' functionality, and executing trading based on the calculated lot size and hotkey functionalities.

## Lot Calculation Algorithm
The main function of this code is `calculateLot(stopLoss)`, which calculates the appropriate lot size based on the specified stop loss value. It uses the following steps:

1. Retrieve the account balance using `AccountInfoDouble(ACCOUNT_BALANCE)`.
2. Set the risk percentage to 0.02 (adjustable as per requirements).
3. Calculate the risk amount by multiplying the account balance with the risk percentage.
4. Get the point value using `SymbolInfoDouble(_Symbol, SYMBOL_TRADE_TICK_VALUE)`.
5. Calculate the stop loss in points by multiplying the stop loss value with the point value.
6. Calculate the lot size by dividing the risk amount by the stop loss in points, and rounding it to 2 decimal places using `NormalizeDouble()`.
7. Return the calculated lot size.

## Functions
1. `setLimitOrderPriceLevel()`: This function is responsible for setting the limit order price level. You can add the necessary code for setting the limit order price level within this function.

2. `key2Functionality()`: This function specifies the functionality for key '2'. You can add the code for the desired functionality within this function.

3. `additionalHotKeyFunctionalities()`: This function specifies additional hotkey functionalities. You can add the code for the desired additional hotkey functionalities within this function.

4. `executeTrading()`: This function executes the trading based on the calculated lot size and the implemented hotkey functionalities. You can add the code for executing the trading strategy within this function.

## Execution
The code is executed within the `OnStart()` function. The following steps are performed:

1. The stop loss value is set to 50.0 (can be adjusted).
2. The `calculateLot(stopLoss)` function is called to calculate the lot size based on the stop loss value.
3. The calculated lot size is displayed using `Print()`.
4. The `setLimitOrderPriceLevel()` function is called to set the limit order price level.
5. The `key2Functionality()` function is called to execute the specified functionality for key '2'.
6. The `additionalHotKeyFunctionalities()` function is called to execute additional hotkey functionalities.
7. The `executeTrading()` function is called to execute the trading based on the calculated lot size and implemented hotkey functionalities.

Please note that this code is provided as a sample and should be integrated into a comprehensive trading system to achieve desired results.
